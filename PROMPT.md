## Technical Implementation Details

### Detection Algorithm
- **Base threshold**: 0.4 (configurable)
- **Consecutive frames required**: 3 for laugh start, 5 for laugh end
- **Feature weights**: Mouth 40%, Eyes 30%, Cheeks 30%
- **History size**: 20 frames for temporal analysis
- **Scoring system**: 0-100 composite score

### Database Schema
```sql
meme_responses (
    id, meme_id, meme_url, meme_title, meme_source,
    timestamp, viewed_duration, laugh_detected,
    laugh_intensity, laugh_confidence, laugh_count,
    max_intensity, meme_tags, laugh_score
)
```

### Meme Sources
- **Reddit**: r/memes, r/funny, r/dankmemes, r/wholesomememes, r/me_irl
- **Memedroid**: Multiple categories with rotation
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new sources

## 🚧 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Issues
1. **Calibration Implementation**: The calibration system is partially implemented but needs completion
2. **Real-time Frame Collection**: Calibration needs to collect frames from the active camera stream
3. **Performance Optimization**: Large meme queues may cause memory issues
4. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases need better handling

### Technical Debt
1. **Threading**: Camera loop could be more robust
2. **Caching**: Image caching system needs size limits
3. **Configuration**: File-based config loading not implemented
4. **Testing**: Unit tests are incomplete

## 🎯 Next Development Priorities

### High Priority
